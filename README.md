# histGram
a motion controlled synth -sounds like hell

made with openframeWorks and ofxMaxim - Maximillian can be found here https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian

The synth can be controlled gesturally using a webcam. 

The four corners of the camera input are linked to various oscillators

The code is responding to movement in these areas - the faster you move, the more happens
The intention is to make Histogram of Gradients feature from the motion data, but i haven't got there yet..
